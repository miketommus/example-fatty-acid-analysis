# EXAMPLE FATTY ACID ANALYSIS

This is an R script, written in Quarto markdown, that demonstrates how raw peak area data from a GCMS is processed into a useable form (concentration and/or proportion data); ready for plotting and statistical analysis. 

The data in the /data directory comes from a real analysis of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) with the exception of two dummy fatty acids (FA) added for testing purposes (18:1w9t & 20:1w5).
